## Backup Team Training Manual
### Version 1.0

## 1. Purpose

This manual is written ONLY for Backup Team members.

Your job is data protection. Nothing is safe until it's verified.

---

## 2. Your Role as Backup Team

You are responsible for:
- Ensuring all videos are backed up
- Ensuring backups are verified
- Monitoring backup coverage
- Rotating disks according to policy
- Reporting gaps immediately

**Backups without verification do NOT count.**

---

## 3. Backup Workflow

### Standard Process

1. **Insert** registered backup disk
2. **Wait** for system backup mode activation
3. **Copy** new files only (system guides you)
4. **Wait** for checksum verification
5. **Confirm** verification status
6. **Rotate** disks as instructed
7. **Report** any issues

---

## 4. Backup States

| State | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Indexed | File registered | Needs backup |
| Backed Up | Copied to disk | Needs verification |
| Verified | Checksum confirmed | Complete ✅ |
| Issue | Problem detected | Investigate |

**Only "Verified" status means the file is safe.**

---

## 5. Disk Registration

Before using a backup disk:

1. Connect the disk
2. System detects new disk
3. Register with name and purpose
4. Disk is now authorized

### Disk Purposes
- **Primary**: Main backup destination
- **Secondary**: Redundant backup
- **Offsite**: For external storage

---

## 6. Verification Process

### What Verification Does
- Calculates checksum of backup file
- Compares with original file checksum
- Confirms data integrity

### Verification Results
- ✅ **Match**: Backup is valid
- ❌ **Mismatch**: Backup is corrupted, re-copy needed

**Never skip verification.**

---

## 7. Disk Rotation Policy

### When to Rotate
- Disk reaches 90% capacity
- End of event
- Weekly rotation schedule
- Admin instruction

### Rotation Steps
1. Confirm all files verified
2. Label disk clearly
3. Store securely
4. Register new disk
5. Continue backups

---

## 8. Coverage Monitoring

### Dashboard Shows
- Total media count
- Backed up count
- Verified count
- Pending count
- Coverage percentage

### Target
- **100% coverage** before event ends
- **Zero unverified** files

---

## 9. What to Never Do

- ❌ Assume backup is complete without verification
- ❌ Use unregistered disks
- ❌ Skip verification step
- ❌ Remove disk during copy
- ❌ Ignore coverage gaps
- ❌ Delete original files

---
